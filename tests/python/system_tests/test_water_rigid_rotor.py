"""Reproduces the "RR + HO" data of Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) of
doi:10.1063/5.0333947.

The reference data are from the paper's supporting information
(``RovibData_v2/Fig2/Fig2b.txt`` and ``Fig2c.txt``). They are the levels of
the (100) and (001) vibrational states, relative to the J = 0 ground state,
and the sign of the wavefunction under exchange of hydrogens,
Pex = (-1)^(v3 + K) of each level. Pex=-1 means the wavefunction is
antisymmetric under exchange of hydrogens and thus the spin state must be a
singlet. Pex=1 is the opposite (spin must be a triplet).
