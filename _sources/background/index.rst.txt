Provides notes on the theoretical background of the rovibrational problem
including the relevant equations. Notes are based on DOI: 10.1063/5.0333947.

Notation
********

The following typesetting conventions are used:

- Scalars are in normal font, e.g., |Natom|.
- Tensors (of rank one or higher) are bold, e.g., |zetavec|. When a tensor is
  written in element form the elements are scalars, and are therefore in
  normal font, e.g., :math:`\zeta^\alpha_{i,j}`.
- Operators have hats, e.g., |Hvib|. Tensor operators are also bold, e.g.,
  |jvec|, but their elements are not, e.g., :math:`\jop_\alpha`.
- Anything that depends on the nuclear coordinates or momenta is an operator.
