# rovib
A proof-of-concept library that solves the rovibrational problem

> **Note:** rovib is under active development. The Hamiltonian currently
> contains only the harmonic oscillator term, and the molecular parameters
> are hard-coded for water (see `rovib.water_params`).

## Installation

rovib requires Python 3.12 or newer and NumPy. To install it from a clone of
the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qharm/rovib.git
cd rovib
pip install .
```

Developers should install rovib in editable mode instead, so that changes to
the source are picked up without reinstalling:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The driver, `rovibrational_energies`, takes a molecule, the maximum
vibrational quantum number of each mode (`vmax`), and the total angular
momentum quantum number (`J`). It returns the energies in hartree and the
corresponding eigenvectors. The following computes the harmonic levels of
water:

```python
from rovib import (
    RovibrationalAnsatz,
    dominant_basis_function,
    hartree_to_wavenumber,
    rovibrational_energies,
    water_molecule,
)

water = water_molecule()
vmax, J = 3, 0
energies, eigenvectors = rovibrational_energies(water, vmax, J)

# The eigenvectors are expressed in this basis
ansatz = RovibrationalAnsatz(water.nvib, vmax, J)

wavenumbers = hartree_to_wavenumber(energies)
print(f"Zero-point energy: {wavenumbers[0]:.1f} cm^-1")
for i in range(1, 5):
    bf = dominant_basis_function(eigenvectors[:, i], ansatz)
    print(bf.v, f"{wavenumbers[i] - wavenumbers[0]:.1f} cm^-1")
```

which prints:

```
Zero-point energy: 4710.5 cm^-1
(0, 1, 0) 1649.7 cm^-1
(0, 2, 0) 3299.5 cm^-1
(1, 0, 0) 3830.9 cm^-1
(0, 0, 1) 3940.5 cm^-1
```

The tuples are the vibrational quantum numbers (v1, v2, v3) of the basis
function that dominates each eigenvector.

## Development

### Testing

The unit and system tests use `unittest`:

```sh
python -m unittest discover tests/python
```

### Formatting and linting

Formatting and linting are enforced with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).
To run the hooks automatically on each commit:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
