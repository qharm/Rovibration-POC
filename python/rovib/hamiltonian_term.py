    Terms carry the state needed to evaluate their matrix elements, but

    are in the Hamiltonian. Matrix elements are evaluated by separate
    functions (see :mod:`rovib.hamiltonian_matrix`).

    Adding two terms, or a term and a
    :class:`~rovib.hamiltonian.Hamiltonian`, gives a
    :class:`~rovib.hamiltonian.Hamiltonian`.
